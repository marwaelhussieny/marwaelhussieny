## About Me

I'm a data engineer who builds systems that move and transform large amounts of data. Currently working with pipelines processing 5M+ records, optimizing Spark jobs, and designing AWS data infrastructure.

**Education:** BSc Computer Science, 3.57/4.0  
**Location:** Cairo, Egypt (open to remote)

```python
class DataEngineer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Marwa Elhussieny"
        self.focus = [
            "ETL pipeline architecture",
            "Distributed data processing", 
            "Cloud data infrastructure",
            "Real-time streaming"
        ]
        
    def get_stack(self):
        return {
            "processing": ["Apache Spark", "Apache Airflow", "Kafka"],
            "cloud": ["AWS S3", "Glue", "Redshift", "Lambda"],
            "languages": ["Python", "SQL"],
            "databases": ["Oracle", "PostgreSQL", "MySQL"],
            "tools": ["Docker", "Git", "Power BI"]
        }
