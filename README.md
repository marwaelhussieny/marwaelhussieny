## What I Do

I build data infrastructure. That means designing ETL pipelines, optimizing Spark jobs, and making sure data gets from point A to point B without breaking. Currently working on systems that process millions of records daily.

**My stack:**
- Processing: Apache Spark, Airflow, Kafka
- Cloud: AWS (S3, Glue, Redshift, Lambda)
- Languages: Python, SQL
- Databases: Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Other: Docker, Git, Power BI

## Recent Work

### Enterprise Data Warehouse
Designed and built a data warehouse using Kimball methodology. Set up Airflow DAGs to orchestrate ETL jobs processing 5M+ records. Implemented incremental loading and data quality validation.

### Spark Pipeline Optimization
Rebuilt a batch processing pipeline that was taking hours. Rewrote transformations, adjusted partitioning strategy, reduced runtime by 70%. Now handles 2M+ records daily.

### AWS Serverless Architecture
Built a serverless data pipeline using S3, Glue, and Lambda. Automated data ingestion, transformation, and loading into Redshift. Everything infrastructure-as-code.

### Analytics Dashboards
Created Power BI dashboards with real-time data refresh. Built custom DAX measures for business metrics. Stakeholders actually use them.

## Learning Right Now

Getting into Kafka for real-time streaming, going deeper on Spark internals, exploring Kubernetes for orchestration. Also looking at how to integrate ML models into data pipelines.

## Background

BSc Computer Science, 3.57/4.0. Started with academic projects, now building production systems. Turns out making things work at scale is way different from making them work once.
